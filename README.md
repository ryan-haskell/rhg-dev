# rhg.dev
> a personal website, written with Elm!

### local dev

```
npm start
```

### overview

this is an experiment that uses SSR and Elm. Each page is rendered at build time, and then hydrated client side with a real Elm application.

Hopefully this provides better performance metrics than waiting for JS to load.

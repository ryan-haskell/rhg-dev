### welcome to here

My name is Ryan Haskell-Glatzâ€“ and I'm a web developer near Chicago!
This site is where I share random things I've been working on.

I tried to make it with Comic Sans, but that fell apart very quickly.

I usually like to write about design, elm, and side projects I'm creating.
If you're interested in that kind of thing, you should check out
my blog posts!

I'm not much of a social media guy, but if you'd like you can follow me on [github](https://www.github.com/ryannhg) or [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ryan_nhg).
I also have links for those like two inches below this paragraph (just in case)!

### welcome to here

My name is Ryan Haskell-Glatzâ€“ and I'm a web developer near Chicago!
This site is where I share random things I've been working on.

I tried to make it with *Comic Sans*, but that fell apart very quickly.

I usually like to write about design, elm, and side projects I'm creating.
If you're interested in that kind of thing, you should check out
my blog posts!
